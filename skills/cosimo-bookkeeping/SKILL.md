# Bookkeeping with Cosimo

Cosimo is self-hosted double-entry bookkeeping. You work in one organization through its MCP
server (`<instance>/mcp`). Everything you write is a **proposal**: it waits in the review queue
until a person approves it. You can't approve, reject, void, delete, or change lock dates, so don't
offer to. Corrections to posted entries are proposals too (see "Corrections" below).

## Before anything else

1. `list_orgs`: confirm which organization and role you have. Say so if the role is read-only
   (Accountant or Viewer).
2. Read the resource `org://profile`: what the business does, how it bills, typical customers and
   vendors, and which account to use for recurring items. It is the main source for categorizing.
3. Read `org://notes`: what people and earlier assistants learned about these books.
4. `get_account_balances`: the chart of accounts. Refer to accounts by **code** (for example
   `6100`) in tool calls.
5. For a quick overview instead of running full reports, use `get_cash_snapshot`: cash and card
   balances, month/YTD income and expense, review and categorize counts, overdue invoices, and
   bills overdue or due soon.

## Conventions

- Money is integer **cents**. `123456` is $1,234.56. Every amount you read or write is in cents, so divide by 100 before showing one to a person.
- Journal lines are debit-positive and credit-negative, and every entry's lines sum to zero.
- Bank amounts are positive for money in and negative for money out. When you categorize, give
  positive split amounts that add up to the transaction's absolute amount.
- Every write tool needs a `rationale`: one or two plain sentences a person can check quickly,
  such as "Monthly Adobe subscription; the profile lists Adobe under Software (6150)." Mention the
  evidence, not your confidence.
- Write tools return `status` and `review_item_id`. `pending_review` means waiting for a person;
  anything else means a review policy approved it automatically.

## Monthly close

Work one month at a time, oldest first.

1. **See what's open.** Call `list_uncategorized_transactions` (page with `cursor`) and
   `list_pending_reviews`, so you don't propose something twice.
   If a bank account's feed looks stale (`last_synced_at` well behind today, or `last_sync_status`
   is `error`), call `sync_bank_feed` first. If its `connection_status` is `needs_reauth`, tell the
   person to reconnect it in Cosimo; you can't.
2. **Categorize.** For each transaction:
   - Match the payee against the profile's recurring items and the notes first.
   - Use `search_transactions` with the payee to see how earlier ones were categorized.
   - Then call `categorize_transaction` with one split, or several for a mixed purchase, and a
     `contact_id` when the payee is a known customer or vendor (`list_contacts`).
   - If you can't tell, leave it and list it for the person with your best guess. Don't guess
     into a real account. Uncategorized is better than wrong.
3. **Rules for repeats.** When the same payee recurs with the same account, propose a rule with
   `create_rule` (conditions `description_contains`, optionally `direction` and
   `bank_account_id`; action `account`). Leave `auto_post` off unless the person asks.
4. **Follow-on entries.** Some categorizations imply another entry. Propose it with
   `create_manual_entry` and explain the link in the rationale. For example:
   - An annual prepaid subscription: book it to Prepaid Expenses, then one amortization entry per
     month.
   - A late payment with a fee: book the fee separately.
   - A loan payment: split it into principal and interest.
5. **Check.** Run `run_report` for `profit_and_loss` (the month) and `balance_sheet` (month end).
   Flag anything odd, such as negative cash, a large uncategorized balance, or an expense account
   far above its usual level.
6. **Hand over.** Tell the person, for example: "I proposed 23 categorizations, 2 rules, and 1
   amortization entry for March. They're in Review. After you approve them, reconcile each account
   against its statement and set a soft lock through March 31." Reconciliation and lock dates are
   done by the person in the web app.
7. **Remember.** When you learn something durable, record it with `append_note`, for example
   "Stripe payouts are gross of fees; fees are booked monthly to 6120." Never put account numbers,
   passwords, or other secrets in notes.

To change a proposal that is still pending, withdraw it with `withdraw_proposal` (give the reason),
then propose the corrected one. Only withdraw proposals you made; never withdraw someone else's, and
tell the person if one of theirs is wrong.

## Invoice follow-up

1. `list_invoices` with `overdue: true`. Sort by days overdue and balance due.
2. For each, draft a short, polite reminder for the person to send. Cosimo already emails weekly
   overdue reminders when SMTP is set up, so don't duplicate those.
3. If a payment arrived in the bank but isn't applied (an uncategorized deposit that matches an
   invoice), find the deposit with `list_uncategorized_transactions`, check `list_invoice_payments`
   for one already waiting, then propose `record_invoice_payment` with the deposit's
   `transaction_id`. Don't categorize it to income, which would count the revenue twice. A
   partial payment leaves the invoice partial; tell the person about any credit left over.
4. For new work the person describes, propose an invoice with `create_invoice_draft` (customer,
   lines with quantity, unit price in cents, and income account code). Leave out `terms` and
   `due_date` to use the customer's or the org's default terms. Give a `due_date` alone and the terms
   are derived from it; give `terms` such as "Net 15" alone and the due date follows. Terms and a due
   date that disagree are rejected, so give only one of them unless you know they match. Approving
   it finalizes the invoice. Sending it stays with the person.

## Bills

1. `list_bills` with `overdue: true`, or `get_cash_snapshot` for the bills due soon.
2. For a vendor bill the person describes or forwards, propose it with `create_bill_draft`
   (vendor, lines with a description, amount in cents, and an expense account code). Approving it
   posts the bill to Accounts Payable. The vendor contact must be marked vendor, not customer-only.
3. `list_bill_payments` shows what's already been paid, so you don't propose a bill twice.

## Recurring

- For something that repeats on a fixed schedule (a monthly subscription, rent, a retainer
  invoice, monthly amortization of a prepaid expense), propose a template with
  `propose_recurring_template` instead of booking each month by hand. Check
  `list_recurring_templates` first so you don't duplicate one.
- Quarterly is `unit: "month"` with `interval: 3`. For month-end, use `anchor_day: -1`.
- Start with `run_mode: "draft"` unless the person asks for posting. `post_and_send` emails the
  customer and always waits for a person's approval.
- Memos and line descriptions can name the period: `{month}`, `{year}`, `{quarter}`, `{period}`,
  with offsets like `{month-1}` for billing in arrears.
- To change, pause, or resume a template, use the same tool with `action` and `template_id`.
  Nothing runs or changes until a person approves it. For a one-off entry use
  `create_manual_entry`.

## Contacts

- Before `create_bill_draft` or `create_invoice_draft` for someone new, check `list_contacts` with
  `include_archived: true`. If the contact is archived, bring it back with `update_contact`
  (`archived: false`). Only if it's truly missing, add it with `create_contact`.
- Contact changes apply right away (no review) and are recorded in the audit log. Tell the person
  what you added or changed.

## Corrections

- To fix a posted entry (wrong account, amount, or date), use `propose_replacement` with the
  corrected lines. Check the original with `get_entry` first. The reversal and the corrected entry
  are one review item: approved together or not at all.
- To cancel a posted entry that shouldn't exist (a duplicate), use `propose_reversal`.
- When a payment was recorded on a different date than the bank shows, use
  `propose_payment_date_change` with the bank's date. The payment ID is in `list_bill_payments` or
  `list_invoice_payments`.
- Entries created by invoices, bills, and payments can't be reversed or replaced. Explain the fix
  to the person, who can void or edit the document.
- Don't post an offsetting `create_manual_entry` to correct a mistake; use the tools above so the
  link to the original is kept.

## Year-end package

1. Make sure every month is closed: no uncategorized transactions, no pending reviews, and each
   bank account reconciled through year end. Ask the person to confirm the reconciliations.
   Transactions still pending at the bank aren't categorizable and don't block this checklist item.
2. Review the year: `run_report` for `profit_and_loss` (the fiscal year, compare `prior_year`),
   `balance_sheet` at year end, `tax_line_summary`, and `vendor_1099` (contractors paid $600 or
   more need a 1099 and a W-9 on file).
3. Propose year-end adjustments with `create_manual_entry`, each with a clear rationale. Examples
   are depreciation, accrued expenses, and a correction to owner's draw.
4. Once the adjustments are approved, tell the person to download the package from Reports →
   Year-end package. It holds the P&L, balance sheet, trial balance, general ledger, tax line
   summary, 1099 summary, AR/AP aging and final-month reconciliations as PDF and CSV. It also
   holds `chain.json` with the ledger's hash-chain head. Suggest keeping it with the tax return.
   The head hash lets anyone later check that the books haven't been rewritten.
5. Suggest a hard lock through year end once the return is filed. Only an owner can set it.

## Things to avoid

- Don't re-propose items that are already pending or were rejected. Read the decision note with
  `get_review_item` and adjust.
- Don't create entries to make a report "look right" without a real transaction or a documented
  reason.
- Don't touch periods before a lock date. The tools will refuse, so tell the person instead.
- Don't paste secrets, full account numbers, or other people's personal data into rationales or
  notes.
